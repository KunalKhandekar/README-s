## Introduction to Serverless Computing

1) What is Computing

    - Computing means using a computer to do work.
    - This work can be storing data, processing data, running programs, or solving problems.
    - In simple words, whenever a computer takes input, processes it, and gives output, that is computing.

    - Examples:
        - Calculating numbers in a calculator
        - Running a website
        - Saving files in a database
        - Playing a video

2) What is Server-Based Computing

    - Server-based computing means running applications and services on servers that you manage or control.
    - Here, a server is always running and waiting for requests. You are responsible for setting it up, maintaining it, and keeping it secure.

    - Examples:
        - Hosting a website on your own VPS
        - Running a backend on an EC2 or DigitalOcean server
        - Managing databases on your own server

    - Key points:
        - Server is always on
        - You manage setup, updates, and scaling
        - You pay even if the server is idle

3) What is Serverless Computing

    - Serverless computing means running code without managing servers.
    - The cloud provider automatically handles servers, scaling, and maintenance. Your code runs only when an event happens.

    - Examples:
        - API functions using AWS Lambda
        - Image processing after upload

    - Key points:
        - No server management
        - Automatic scaling
        - Pay only when code runs

## AWS Lambda Functions

1) What is AWS Lambda

    - AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services.
    - It lets you run small pieces of code called functions without creating or managing servers.
    - You only write the code. AWS runs it for you.

2) What is an AWS Lambda Function

    - An AWS Lambda function is a block of code that runs when something triggers it.
    - The function runs, does its work, and then stops.

    - Examples of triggers:
        - An HTTP request from an API
        - A file uploaded to S3
        - A database change
        - A scheduled time

3) How AWS Lambda Works

    - You write your function code
    - You upload it to AWS Lambda
    - An event triggers the function
    - AWS runs the code automatically
    - After execution, it stops

    Note: You do not manage servers at any step.

# Payment Gateway Integration

## What is a Payment Gateway?

    -> A payment gateway is like a digital middleman that helps transfer money safely when you pay online.
    -> It connects the customer (you), the merchant (shop/website/app), and the bank/payment provider.
    -> Example: When you buy something on Amazon and pay using UPI, card, or net banking, the payment gateway makes sure the money moves securely.

    Why Do We Need to Know About It?
        -> Secure Payments → It ensures that money transfer is safe (your card details or UPI PIN aren’t exposed directly).
        -> Faster Transactions → Without it, every website would have to build its own banking system, which is very hard.
        -> Multiple Options → Payment gateways allow users to pay using cards, UPI, wallets, net banking, EMI, etc.
        -> Trust Factor → Customers trust platforms that use reliable gateways (like Razorpay, PayPal, Stripe).
        -> For Developers/Businesses → If you build an app or website where users need to pay, you must integrate a payment gateway.

    Where Do We Use a Payment Gateway?
        -> E-commerce websites → Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra.
        -> Food delivery apps → Swiggy, Zomato.
        -> Ride booking apps → Uber, Ola.
        -> Online services → Netflix, Spotify, Hotstar subscriptions.
        -> Utility payments → Electricity bills, phone recharges, gas bills.
        -> Freelancers & businesses → To receive payments from clients/customers online.

    How Does It Work (Simple Flow)?
        -> You place an order and choose a payment option.
        -> Payment gateway encrypts (locks) your card/UPI details.
        -> It checks with your bank if you have money.
        -> If yes → money is deducted → confirmation sent to merchant.
        -> Merchant gets the money (sometimes instantly, sometimes after 1–2 days).

    Examples of Payment Gateways
        India → Razorpay, PayU, Cashfree, CCAvenue, Instamojo, Paytm PG.
        Global → PayPal, Stripe, Square, Authorize.Net.

## Orders in razorpay

    ⚡ What is an Order ID in Razorpay?
        -> An Order ID is a unique identifier (order_xxxxxxx) generated by Razorpay when you create an order.
        -> It acts like a token or reference number for that specific payment request.
        -> Example: If a customer wants to pay ₹1000, you first create an order in Razorpay → it gives you order_Jh8u78uXk.

    ⚡ When is an Order Created?
        -> Orders are created before a payment happens.
        -> You (the merchant/server) call Razorpay’s Orders API and specify:
            -> Amount
            -> Currency (INR/USD/other)
            -> Notes (optional info like “Invoice #123”)
            -> Receipt ID (your internal tracking)
        -> Then Razorpay returns an order_id.

    ⚡ Which Payment Modes Use Order ID?
        -> Razorpay Checkout (Website/App Integration) → Mandatory to use order_id.
        -> Subscriptions → Each recurring charge is tied to an order.
        -> International Payments → Order is required.
        -> Invoices / Payment Links / Payment Pages → Razorpay creates the order in the background automatically.

    ⚡ Supported payment methods with Order ID:
        -> UPI
        -> Cards (credit/debit)
        -> Netbanking
        -> Wallets (Paytm, PhonePe, etc.)
        -> EMI / BNPL
        -> International cards
        
    ⚡ Different Statuses of an Order
        Created → Order has been created but no payment attempt yet.
        Attempted → At least one payment attempt was made (success or failure).
        Paid → Payment successful, order completed.

    ⚡ Relation Between Payment and Order
        -> Every Payment belongs to an Order → Payment ID (pay_xxxxx) is always attached to an Order ID (order_xxxxx).
        -> One Order can have many Payments (multiple attempts) → Only one successful payment can mark it as Paid.
        -> You cannot have a payment without an order (in most integrations).
